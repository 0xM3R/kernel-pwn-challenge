Pwn the kernel and pop a root shell!

Source is available inside /src.


eth0 receives an IP address via dhcp. It may be helpful to do
development on the host and send binaries to the VM:

On the VM:
    /home $ while true; do nc -l -p 1234 > a; chmod +x a; ./a; done

On the host:
    $ gcc -static -o a vuln.c && nc 192.168.56.102 1234 < a
